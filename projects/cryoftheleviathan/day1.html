<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; color: white; font-size: 14px; "> The day has passed with little event. If the remainder of our mission goes like this, you'll find me sleeping peacefully and comfortably for every last minute of it. I mean, Eriksson's got a lot to do, and I wish I could help him, but frankly, I don't have the knowledge or certifications to do that. After all, he's a senior naval officer, and I'm just a recruit. A junior one, too. Although I'm labelled as "promising" — guess I'm a special girl, huh? I don't really see what that's even all about. I mean, I know I did really well on the entrance exams, but I find it hard to believe I did so well that the Commander <u>&amp;</u> Administrator have their eye keen on me. How did more people <u>not</u> do well on those exams? I thought them to be really easy. Maybe everyone's a dumbass, who knows? It's not hard to believe that when you see the idiocracies world wide, or even the kakistocracy in Korea. Can't even forget the lovely shenanigans we've caused off in that "Other Earth" or whatever it's called. I don't keep up with that place, but I feel bad for them nonetheless. But let's shift to the mission I've embarked on, lest I forget. I must say, Eriksson is a lovely old man, and I appreciate he sees me no less than he, unlike <u>some</u> people back in HQ. I'm only with him because everyone else was either busy or didn't want to go, because usually recruits don't do these kinds of things. No, they spend their first year training to move up, and maybe a mission here and there. But me? I've been here for a month and I'm already on this rickety ship, tredging through the waters in tandem with the Mariana Islands. Speaking of the waters, we've been in contact with HQ (specifically HQ because the guys up top <u>really</u> seem to think I'm special) about our observations, which so far have been rather mundane, except for this one mysterious signal off to our west. We don't know what causes it, but there's reasonable speculation it's related to what's caused the disturbances we've set off to observe. I guess working with HQ has its benefits — they work very fast.
