<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; color: white; font-size: 14px; "> Not to sound panicked or anything, but I am. I’m not sure if I’m at Death’s door or not. I think I might die, truthfully. We are facing a being beyond our comprehension right now, something clearly not from this Earth at all. If there’s a God out there, somewhere in the Universe, I think he’s truly angry. We are facing something that almost takes a sadistic pleasure in our fear and futile attempts to subdue it. HQ is trying to send reinforcements, as fast as possible, but they need the big guns, and it takes a while to get the big guns. This leviathan...he’s a sight to behold. Green in scales, with sharp big blue eyes and enough teeth for a city to feed on, all a hellish yellow-red. And he attacks but so oddly. He’ll do it every which way, from underneath, leaping at above, with his tail, or even from the 300 dark tentacles erupting from him like evolution had a few too many drinks one night. But he’s no being from Earth, that has to be true. I refuse to believe otherwise. Ah, yes, how can one forget about the wretched storm we survived. Rain like bullets, clouds black as coal, the waves of the sea possessed and turned into death. And the gale, strong enough to root whole cities, if I had seen it torture some place like London or Tokyo. Yet fate had chosen two helpless instead. First the storm, then the beast. I shan’t sleep tonight, I can't. The threat outside pulls me away from this book of solace. Yet this page lay incomplete. Maybe I’ll use it tomorrow, if I still exist.

<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; color: white; font-size: 14px; "> I can write until the beast capsizes the ship. He has sunken into a full rage. This book may not survive. It is noon, with cloudy skies. I’ve found a short peace, I’ll write now. Rescue should come shortly. But I’ve found something intriguing. This leviathan? It came from the Mariana Trench, but it was planted here. Planted by the people here to (INK BLOT) Dear god, he’s returned. Farewell, old companion.
