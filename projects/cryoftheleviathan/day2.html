<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; color: white; font-size: 14px; "> Today was certainly more interesting than yesterday, that's certain. I mean, first of all, we saw more disturbances — more unusual waves, more unusual low booms, all that fun stuff we can't get our heads around. That signal from yesterday still persists, which that + everything else is driving everyone at HQ crazy. Yet, there was something most peculiar we encountered. We found a goddamn siren. Yes, like the little singing bastards from the Odyssey (GREAT read if you haven't already, might I add). That was fun to deal with. I should write from the start of the ordeal. The first of it happened as we approached the island of Agrihan, which is otherwise a rather uneventful place in every usage of the word. Then, when we were some 30 miles south of it still, (if this ship stopped rocking so much, maybe I could actually write) we heard the low chants emanating from where Agrihan was. As we continued on north, it became increasingly loud and almost hypnotizing in the beauty of the singer and her certainly entrancing voice. So much so, the command of HQ came down upon us once more and ordered us to go and find this damned siren and seize her. And that we did, with relative ease. I don't know why she sat on the coast — should've climbed up onto the peak and sang from there. Regardless, we took her, brought her inside, and interrogated her, as per the orders given. This was a nightmare if I was ever awake for one. We could figure out right from the get-go that she had her connections to the other unsolved mysteries, but beyond that, she was her own enigma. Putting aside the fact that a great language barrier stood between us, she seemed utterly unmoved by our questions, not even acknowledging them and instead speaking when she herself willed. Eriksson had no patience for such bullshit — after about 30 minutes of this, he took to his trusty rifle, put it at her head, and now HQ's mad at us for not only neutralizing a potential key to this gate of anomaly, but also staining a good chunk of the interior of the ship with blood. Also, I must add, that siren was not at all how I expected her to look. She was rather plain and clothed, although very beautiful in plainness. Maybe tomorrow will give us a solution...
