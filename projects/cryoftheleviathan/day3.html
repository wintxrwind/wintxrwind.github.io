<p style="font-family:'Courier New'; color: white; font-size: 14px; "> Now things are getting out of hand. This must be how Dr. Jekyll felt when he began becoming Hyde against his own will, and it dawned on him that maybe he had overstayed his visit into the fog of science for too long. It took until now, well into the night, for the oddities to settle that I may write. Well, let’s get the good news out of the way — we saw it. The whole thing we made this mission to look for. Well, <u>we</u> didn’t see it, but a heli making a routine delivery spotted it. They’re calling it a “leviathan”, and that entices me. We got the news right as we were turning back, hailing west and a bit south of our position then. But things went awry as we made our way there. First came this fierce, freezing and bittern wind, from where this leviathan-like creature was spotted. Need it be mentioned the strangeness of that in a tropical sea? All of a sudden, we went from the Phillipine Sea straight to the Bering Strait. In August. It wasn’t too long before we were dodging icebergs. Furthermore, something more disturbing befell us. Like rain, flocks of birds crashed down onto the Earth, and us by proxy. It was frightening. Poor Eriksson had a bird fall right upon his back, wings splayed like an albatross. There was so, so much more, but the rest of it doesn’t come to me now. There's too much for the poor human mind to dwell on really. I heard from Eriksson that there was some more oddities under the surface, but he’s the one that’s been checking that, not me. If only I never volunteered to do this...well, then the Commander &amp; Administrator would be giving me special treatment some other way, Like, Jesus, why can;t they leave me alone. My exam score can’t be that special, can it? Besides, I didn’t even go to their special academy or whatever where people like the Elites went. I’m only here because I needed something to do after school that was interesting. Now I’m either treated like some prodigy or a carton of spoiled milk, and not much in between. Well...maybe tomorrow will be interesting in a <u>better</u> way — none of this eldritch horror bullshit like we’re in Lovecraft’s dreams.
